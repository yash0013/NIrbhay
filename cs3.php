                              <h5><strong>Introduction:</strong></h5>
                              <p>Investigative journalist Brian Krebs exposed the security breach at Wipro Ltd, a major Indian IT outsourcing firm, revealing how the company's systems became a launchpad for phishing expeditions targeting numerous client systems.</p>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            <ul>
                              <h5><strong>Background:</strong></h5>
                              <p>The incident, reported on April 15, raised concerns as Wipro's systems were exploited for phishing attacks on its clients. Wipro initially sought time to investigate before confirming a phishing incident on April 17.</p>
                          </ul>
                          <br/>
                            <ul>
                              <h5><strong>Incident Overview:</strong></h5>
                              <p>Wipro faced a security breach involving advanced phishing campaigns. The breach, termed a multi-month intrusion by a state-sponsored attacker, impacted at least a dozen clients. The company acknowledged abnormal activity in some employee accounts.</p>
                              
                          </ul>
                          <br/>
                            <ul>
                              <h5><strong>Attack Method:</strong></h5>
                              <p>The attackers utilised advanced phishing techniques, targeting employees through email campaigns. Subsequent investigation revealed malicious activities on over 100 Wipro endpoints, with attackers employing tools like Screen Connect and Mimikats.</p>
                            </ul>
                          <br/>
