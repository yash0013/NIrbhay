                              <p>On April 9, 2017, The Infamous Incident Involving The Forcible Removal Of A Passenger From United Express Flight 3411 At Chicago O'Hare International Airport Took Place, Triggering Widespread Outrage And A Significant Impact On United Airlines' Reputation.</p>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            <ul>
                              <h5><strong>Background:</strong></h5>
                              <p>United Removed Passengers To Accommodate Deadheading Employees, Leading To A Confrontation With Dr. David Dao, Who Suffered Injuries During The Forced Removal. The Incident Unfolded Due To The Need To Reposition A Crew Delayed In Reaching Their Next Assignment.</p>
                          </ul>
                          <br/>
                            <ul>
                              <h5><strong>Incident Overview:</strong></h5>
                              <p>The Situation Escalated When Dr. Dao, A Vietnamese-American Pulmonologist, Refused To Leave The Plane, Citing The Need To Attend To Patients The Next Day. The Security Officers' Use Of Force Resulted In Dao Being Bloodied And Bruised, Causing A Public Relations Disaster For United.</p>
                              
                          </ul>
                          <br/>
                            <ul>
                              <h5><strong>Attack Method:</strong></h5>
                              <p>The Incident Was Not A Traditional Cyber-Attack But Rather A Mishandled Customer Service Situation. United's Decision To Involuntarily Remove Passengers, Algorithmic Selection, And Subsequent Use Of Force Became The Focal Point Of Criticism.</p>
                            </ul>
                          <br/>

                              <h5><strong>Impact:</strong></h5>
                               <p>The Incident Had Severe Repercussions For United Airlines, Leading To A Decline In Stock Prices, Public Backlash, And Damage To The Company's Reputation. The Use Of Force Against A Paying Passenger Sparked Widespread Condemnation.</p>

                                <p>The Aftermath Prompted Investigations By Authorities, Public Outrage, And Scrutiny Of United's Policies. United CEO Oscar Munoz Initially Downplayed The Incident But Later Issued Apologies And Policy Changes.</p>

                            </ul>
