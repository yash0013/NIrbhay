                              <h5><strong>Introduction:</strong></h5>
                              <p>The rise of deepfake technology has led to a concerning trend where celebrities, including Alia Bhatt, become victims of manipulated videos. The misuse of artificial intelligence raises ethical and privacy issues, impacting individuals' public images.</p>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            <ul>
                              <h5><strong>Background:</strong></h5>
                              <p>Celebrities like Rashmika Mandanna, Katrina Kaif, and Kajol have faced deepfake controversies, emphasising the prevalence of this issue in the realm of social media. The use of AI to superimpose faces onto different bodies creates misleading content.</p>
                          </ul>
                          <br/>
                            <ul>
                              <h5><strong>Incident Overview:</strong></h5>
                              <p>Alia Bhatt recently became the target of a deepfake video where her facial features were incorporated into the footage of another woman. The manipulated clip circulated on social media, showing the fabricated content of Alia making various gestures, raising concerns about the potential harm caused by such technology.</p>
                              
                          </ul>
                          <br/>
                            <ul>
                              <h5><strong>Attack Method:</strong></h5>
                              <p>Deepfake technology, utilising artificial intelligence algorithms, seamlessly merges faces onto different bodies, creating realistic-looking but entirely fabricated videos. In this case, Alia Bhatt's face was superimposed onto another woman's face, leading to the creation of a deceptive video.</p>
                            </ul>
                          <br/>
                            <ul>
                              <h5><strong>Impact:</strong></h5>
                               <p>The incident has implications for the privacy and reputation of celebrities. Deepfake videos can be misused to spread false information or damage an individual's image, causing distress and concerns about vulnerability to such technological manipulations.</p>

                              <h5><strong>Investigation:</strong></h5>
                                <p>The response from Alia Bhatt and authorities regarding the deepfake video remains unreported. The incident prompts the need for increased awareness, legal measures, and possibly technological solutions to address the misuse of deepfake technology.</p>
                            </ul>
                          <br/>
