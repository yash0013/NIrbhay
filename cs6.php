                              <h5><strong>Introduction:</strong></h5>
                              <p>Julian Gutmanis, an experienced cyber first responder, faced a chilling incident in the summer of 2017 at a Saudi petrochemical plant.
                                The plant had fallen victim to a cyberattack involving Triton malware, raising concerns about the deliberate targeting of safety systems.
                                </p>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            <ul>
                              <h5><strong>Background:</strong></h5>
                              <p>Cyberattacks on industrial facilities become more prevalent.
                                The incident reveals a shift towards compromising critical safety systems, posing potential life-threatening consequences.
                                </p>
                          </ul>
                          <br/>
                            <ul>
                              <h5><strong>Incident Overview:</strong></h5>
                              <p>The Triton malware infiltrated the plant's safety instrumented systems, designed to prevent life-threatening disasters.
                                The attackers aimed to remotely control these systems, with the potential to cause catastrophic outcomes.</p>
                              
                          </ul>
                          <br/>
                            <ul>
                              <h5><strong>Attack Method:</strong></h5>
                              <p>The hackers gained access to the plant's corporate and operational networks, exploiting a vulnerability in a poorly configured digital firewall.
                                They targeted an engineering workstation, learned about safety systems, and identified a zero-day vulnerability in Schneider Electric's Triconex safety controller model.
                                The attackers tested the malware on an identical machine, enabling them to mimic communication protocols with safety systems.
                                </p>
                            </ul>
                          <br/>
                            <ul>
                              <h5><strong>Impact:</strong></h5>
                               <p>The malware triggered safety systems, causing plant shutdowns in June and August 2017.
                                The potential consequences included the release of toxic gases or explosions, putting lives at risk in the facility and the surrounding area.
                                </p>

                            </ul>

                              <h5><strong>Investigation:</strong></h5>
                                <p>Triton's existence was revealed in December 2017, with initial attribution pointing to Iran.
                                    Subsequent research by cybersecurity firm FireEye suggested Russian involvement, linking the malware to a Moscow-based organization.
                                    </p>
                            </ul>
